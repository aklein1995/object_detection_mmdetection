## Download Checkpoints
Visit the MMDetection GitHub repository, concretely at [Model Zoo](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/model_zoo.html) section. 

Select the desired Object Detector. 

For instance, [Faster-RCNN](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/main/configs/faster_rcnn), and by clicking "model" download the .pth. Then, move it to ```/checkpoints``` folder.
